# MatriSIMS
GUI Python application to fit and process SIMS data for minerals with matrix effect.

This software is meant to calibrate matrix effect for SIMS analyses of minerals or glass with complex major element composition.
It allows the automatic propagation of the uncertainty on the measured isotopic composition and the uncertainty on the fit for sample data.
